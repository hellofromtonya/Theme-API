 * Customization bootstrap file
 *
 * This file serves as the bootstrap (launching point) for all customization to this theme.
 * You can think of this file as your functions.php for customization.  You want to make your
 * changes here, include any customization files, etc.
 *
 * Do not make any changes outside of the customization folder, as your changes will be lost
 * when the theme is updated.  However, everything in this folder will be retained upon
 * theme updates.  WooHoo, yes, you heard me right!
